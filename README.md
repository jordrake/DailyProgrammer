Daily Programmer
==================

This is a repository for my solutions of the Reddit Daily Programmer challenges.

My aim is to make them all runnable in browser with an interface where possible.

I don't have a particular order for completing these and I'm not going for the maximum performance or a ridiculously small filesize but I will try to avoid redundancy.

Feel free to raise issues if you find bugs or incredibly inefficient solutions.
